          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <h5>Photographer</h5>
          <p>
            Hi! I am a photographer by hobby and an Engineer by profession. I
            operate from Bangalore but I am ready to travel anywhere in the
            world to capture good photos.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have been working in the field of photography for the past 3 years
            by now and in the field of wedding photography for about a year. The
            reason why I became a wedding photographer is that it gives me the
            opportunity to capture all kinds of emotions, feelings, and memories
            in such a beautiful way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, I have a lot of great experience working in the field,
            and I can capture weddings, birthdays, corporate events, ceremonies,
            candids, and portraits. Available for both Photography and
            Videography.
